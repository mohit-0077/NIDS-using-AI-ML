NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM USING AI/ML

This project presents an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning to 
enhance network security by identifying and classifying potential cyber threats.

Problem Statement :
The motivation behind the “Network Intrusion Detection Using ML” project is driven 
by the exponential growth of cyber threats and attacks, which have posed significant 
challenges to the security of computer networks. Traditional network intrusion 
detection systems (IDS) based on rule-based approaches often struggle to keep pace 
with the ever-evolving attack landscape.

Model Used :
This IDS project specifically leverages two machine 
learning algorithms: Random Forest and Support Vector Machine
